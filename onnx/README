[ILD full simulation, 800k jet each for training]
- ilc_nnqq_neutrals
  3-category training by ZH->nnjj (j = b, c, d)
- ilc_nnqq_strange_cpidfullprob
  6-category training by ZH->nnjj (j = b, c, s, d, u, g)
- ilc_nnqq_strainge_cpidprob_mcpdg
  11-category training by ZH->nnjj (j = b, c, s, d, u + anti-quarks + g)

3-category is expected to be used without any modification from mc-2020 sample.
6- and 11-category need reprocessing with Comprehensive PID for mc-2020 sample.
